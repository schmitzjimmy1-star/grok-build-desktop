# GrokBuild Desktop App

GrokBuild Desktop App is a native SwiftUI macOS shell for the [`grok`](https://grok.com) CLI — a project-focused agent UI with persistent workspaces, resumable sessions, and settings for CLI features.

You can also install GrokBuild just to manage custom OpenAI-compatible models in **Settings → Models** (writes `~/.grok/config.toml`; no project or session needed), then use them in the grok TUI.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later
- The `grok` CLI installed, usually at `~/.grok/bin/grok`
- A logged-in CLI session — run `grok login` in Terminal before starting your first session (not needed if you only manage custom models)

## Quick Start

### Start with a project

1. Install and sign in to the `grok` CLI (`grok login`).
2. Download a notarized release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rimusz/grok-build-desktop/releases) and move `GrokBuild.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open GrokBuild Desktop App and choose **Add Project**.
4. Pick a folder. It can be a code repo, a docs folder, or a scratch workspace.
5. Start a session. GrokBuild Desktop App launches `grok agent stdio` for that project and streams it in the app.

### Custom models only

If you mainly use the grok TUI or CLI and just need a UI for providers and models:

1. Install the `grok` CLI and open GrokBuild Desktop App (no project or `grok login` required for this path).
2. Open **Settings → Models**.
3. Install a provider (endpoint + API key), then add one or more OpenAI-compatible models.
4. Entries are written to `~/.grok/config.toml` and work with the grok CLI/TUI via `/model <id>` — and in GrokBuild sessions if you use them later.

## What GrokBuild Desktop App Is

GrokBuild Desktop App owns the macOS window, project sidebar, session tabs, settings UI, browser/computer-use enablement, and local app update flow. A common lightweight use is **Settings → Models** alone: manage custom providers and models for the shared `~/.grok/config.toml` without opening a project or starting a session.

It is **not** a replacement for the CLI. The `grok` CLI still owns agent reasoning, ACP, MCP tools, models, skills, subagents, plan mode, permissions, memory, hooks, plugins, and `AGENTS.md` instructions.

## Install

Download a notarized release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/rimusz/grok-build-desktop/releases), then move `GrokBuild.app` to `/Applications` (or run it from the extracted folder). Releases are signed and notarized — no Gatekeeper workarounds needed.

Release assets are versioned, e.g. `GrokBuild-v0.1.10.app.zip` and `GrokBuild-v0.1.10-macOS.dmg`.

## Feature Highlights

### Sessions

- Streaming agent sessions for `grok agent stdio` with Markdown, compact thinking disclosures placed above their assistant answers, live tool cards, permission prompts, plan/question cards, and diff review.
- Multi-tab sessions with lazy restore, resumable grok sessions, a session browser, and transcript recovery from grok's on-disk `chat_history.jsonl` when possible.
- Monochrome graphite visual system with a compact native SF type scale, centered reading column, flat matte surfaces, restrained corner radii, and no decorative avatars or status pills.
- Minimal composer controls for model, mode, context usage, voice dictation, attachments, and a single **Skills and workflows** menu for skill, research, workflow, and imagine commands. Secondary session controls stay collapsed until requested.
- Spacious Codex-style empty state with four monochrome quick-start cards; use **Clear** on an Empty session to remove it from the tab strip.

### Project Workflow

- Collapsible project sidebar with pinned projects, recent sessions, session rename/close, one-click **New Project** onboarding, and an on-demand project filter. The chat toolbar keeps a sidebar toggle visible in the full-width canvas, moves secondary actions into one menu, and opens Settings directly.
- Full-width Settings workspace with one compact internal navigation rail and a centered 760 pt content column; opening Settings never brings the project sidebar back or stacks two sidebars together. Switches use one small trailing control column, permission editors stay shallow and neutral, and Marketplace sources stack above the full-width plugin list instead of squeezing it into a split view. Technical monospace typography is reserved for actual commands and diagnostic logs.
- Per-tab **model** selection and per-project **reasoning effort** through one compact native menu with Model and Effort submenus.
- Git branch/worktree management from the session status row.
- `Open in` menu for Finder, Cursor, VS Code, Terminal, iTerm, and Zed.
- **Custom models (standalone)** — OpenAI-compatible providers and models in **Settings → Models**, written to `~/.grok/config.toml`. Usable on its own (no project/session); models are then available in the grok CLI/TUI and in GrokBuild sessions.

### Agent Capabilities

- **Main agents** — browse agents discovered by `grok inspect --json`, choose the default agent for new sessions, or override the active tab from Session controls. These choices pass through as `grok --agent` and restart the affected session.
- **Custom subagents (roles)** — create reusable roles with a name, optional model, and instruction. GrokBuild Desktop App writes them to `[subagents.roles.*]` in `~/.grok/config.toml` and stores instructions in `~/.grok/prompts/<name>.md`.
- **Using subagents** — keep the main agent as Default and prompt normally; grok delegates to matching subagents automatically, or you can ask for one by name (for example, *"use the researcher subagent to map the auth flow"*). **Run as custom role** in the agent picker runs the whole session as that role instead of spawning a child subagent. To block spawning child subagents, use **Settings → Permissions**.
- Inspect hooks, plugins, marketplace sources (install/enable/disable), compatibility layers (Cursor/Claude/Codex), skills, MCP servers, and session permissions from Settings.

### Optional Automation

Enable Browser and Computer Use from **Settings → Browser** / **Settings → Computer Use**, then **Apply and Restart**, or use the matching items in Session controls when a session is active.

- **Browser control** — let Grok drive a real Chromium browser via `browser_*` MCP tools backed by [`agent-browser`](https://agent-browser.dev). Use a managed automation profile or attach to Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, or another Chromium browser over CDP.
- **Computer Use** — let Grok drive native macOS UI via `computer_*` MCP tools backed by [`agent-desktop`](https://github.com/lahfir/agent-desktop), with action policy, step limits, timeouts, and optional Cursor MCP integration.
- **Memory** — experimental and off by default. Enable it from Settings, browse saved memories, and add "Remember" notes from Session controls.
- **Background tasks** — scheduled `/loop` tasks plus background shells, monitors, and subagents mirrored under Session controls. Schedules only fire while GrokBuild Desktop App is open and that session process is alive (inactive tabs may be stopped by LRU eviction).
- **Rhai workflows** — enable in Settings → Workflows (`[workflows] enabled` in config.toml, shared with the grok TUI). Session controls list runs, saved `.grok/workflows/` scripts, and deep research. This is separate from the Skills and workflows menu in the composer.
- **Session tools** — fork session (new tab with `--fork-session`), share link (`/share` + clipboard), `/btw` aside panel, create-skill sheet, and multi-session dashboard grouped by status.
- **Documents and spreadsheets** — use grok's document skills (`xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`) to create, read, edit, and reformat Office files from paths in your workspace. Spreadsheet skills may need [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installed for some conversions.

### App Experience

- A normal windowed Mac app with standard application menus, native SF Symbols, and no redundant status-item applet.
- Grouped vertical Settings navigation keeps all configuration areas readable without a fourteen-tab horizontal traffic jam.
- In-app update panels for both GrokBuild Desktop App and the `grok` CLI. App updates are offered only for signed and notarized releases.
- Dark-mode-first SwiftUI design with accessibility labels for interactive status controls.

## Permissions & Privacy

- GrokBuild Desktop App talks to the local `grok` CLI; your prompts, tool calls, model routing, auth, and CLI-side storage follow the CLI's behavior.
- Browser control uses a separate managed Chromium profile by default. If you attach to an existing browser over CDP, Grok can interact with that browser window.
- Computer Use requires macOS Accessibility permission. Screenshots require Screen Recording and are optional.
- You can control tool approval behavior in **Settings → Permissions** and **Settings → Computer Use** (Auto / Ask / Deny, plus limits).

## Building from source

### Minimal setup

You only need **Xcode Command Line Tools**:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

That is enough to compile the app, create the `.app` bundle and DMG, and codesign/notarize.

```bash
make build          # build the release binary
make test           # run unit tests
make run            # build release + launch from .build/GrokBuild.app
make run-debug      # build debug + launch — includes menu **Simulate Updates**
make app            # create dist/GrokBuild.app
make dmg            # create the .app + DMG
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for packaging, signing, notarization, and GitHub releases.

### Opening a self-built (unsigned) app

Local builds from `make app` / `make run` are unsigned. macOS Gatekeeper may block them the first time you open a copied `.app` (for example after moving `dist/GrokBuild.app` to `/Applications`):

1. **Right-click** `GrokBuild.app` → **Open**, then confirm **Open** (bypasses the block once).
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the blocked-app message.
3. Or remove the quarantine attribute:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /path/to/GrokBuild.app
   ```

Self-built apps do not receive in-app upgrade offers. Use a notarized GitHub release for one-click updates, or keep rebuilding from source.

### Recommended for SwiftUI work

If you plan to edit the SwiftUI code, install the **full Xcode** IDE from the App Store for:

- SwiftUI Previews (live canvas) — the biggest advantage
- Better debugging tools (view hierarchy, environment inspection)
- A smoother experience with complex SwiftUI views

You can still build from the terminal with `make` or `swift build` with full Xcode installed:

```bash
xed .          # open Package.swift in Xcode
```

### Signing & notarization

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # optional: SIGN_IDENTITY, NOTARY_PROFILE
make signed SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
make notarize NOTARY_PROFILE=AC_PASSWORD
make release RELEASE_TYPE=notarized
```

Signing requires a **Developer ID Application** certificate, and notarization requires App Store Connect access. Full details: [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

### Developer documentation

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | **Start here** — app structure, data flow, persistence, updates, common tasks → files |
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Agent/copilot entry point |
| [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) | Build, sign, notarize, release CI |

Debug builds (`make run-debug`) include **GrokBuild → Simulate Updates** for testing the update UI without publishing releases. It is compiled out of release builds (`make run`, `make app`, GitHub releases).
